# Platform Withdrawal System Implementation

## Overview

The platform withdrawal system has been implemented to address the mismatch between platform balance and withdrawable amount. The system now provides a complete withdrawal workflow with proper approval and processing mechanisms.

## Key Features

### 1. Platform Balance Management

- **Platform Balance**: Total accumulated platform fees
- **Withdrawable Amount**: Balance minus pending withdrawals
- **Pending Withdrawals**: Withdrawal requests awaiting approval

### 2. Withdrawal Workflow

1. **Request**: Admin requests platform withdrawal with amount and reason
2. **Approval**: Other admins can approve or deny the request
3. **Processing**: Approved withdrawals are processed and balance is updated
4. **Notification**: All parties are notified of status changes

### 3. Database Collections

- `platform_withdrawals`: Stores all platform withdrawal requests
- `settings`: Stores platform balance (system collection)

- Prevents double-spending of platform funds
- Maintains accurate financial records

### 2. Multi-Admin Approval

- Requesters are notified of status changes
- All parties stay informed

## Testing

The system has been tested with mock data to verify:

- ✅ Platform balance calculation
- ✅ Withdrawable amount calculation
- ✅ Pending withdrawals tracking
- ✅ Withdrawal history tracking
- ✅ Approval workflow logic
- ✅ Processing workflow logic
