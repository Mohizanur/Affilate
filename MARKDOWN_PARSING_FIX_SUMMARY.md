# Markdown Parsing Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The Telegram bot was experiencing a "400: Bad Request: can't parse entities: Can't find end of the entity starting at byte offset 109" error when sending messages with Markdown formatting. This error occurred specifically in the admin handlers when displaying user and company lists.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by unescaped special characters in user names and company names when they were wrapped in Markdown asterisks (`*`). For example, usernames containing `@` symbols, spaces, or other special characters were breaking the Markdown parsing.

## Error Example

```
14. âœ… Verified *@yami nur 22 Nas*
   ðŸ‘¤ @omafesrun2
   ðŸ“± +251977822192
   ðŸ’° Balance: $466.30
   ðŸ†” ID: 5879152742
```

The username `@yami nur 22 Nas` contains an `@` symbol and spaces, which when wrapped in Markdown asterisks, caused parsing issues.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `handleAllUsersMenu` function in `bot/handlers/adminHandlers.js`

- Applied `escapeMarkdown()` function to user names, usernames, and phone numbers
- Lines 185-190: Escaped `user.firstName`, `user.lastName`, `user.username`, and `user.phone`

### 2. Fixed `handleAdminListCompanies` function in `bot/handlers/adminHandlers.js`

- Applied `escapeMarkdown()` function to company names and owner usernames
- Lines 820-825: Escaped `company.name` and `ownerUsername`

## Technical Details

### The `escapeMarkdown` function

The function escapes the following special characters that have special meaning in Markdown:

- `_`, `*`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `` ` ``, `>`, `#`, `+`, `-`, `=`, `|`, `{`, `}`, `.`, `!`

### Example

```javascript
// Before fix
msg += `*${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}*\n`;

// After fix
msg += `*${escapeMarkdown(user.firstName)} ${escapeMarkdown(user.lastName)}*\n`;
```

## Testing

The fix was tested with the problematic username `@yami nur 22 Nas` and confirmed that the `escapeMarkdown` function properly handles special characters without breaking the Markdown formatting.

## Impact

This fix resolves the Telegram API parsing errors and ensures that user and company names with special characters are displayed correctly in admin menus without causing the bot to crash.

## Files Modified

- `bot/handlers/adminHandlers.js` - Lines 185-190 and 820-825
