# Platform Analytics and Withdrawal System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Platform Withdrawal Button
**Problem**: The platform analytics dashboard didn't show a withdrawal button for the platform itself, even when there was a withdrawable amount.

**Fix**: Added platform withdrawal button logic in `bot/handlers/adminHandlers.js`:
```javascript
// Add platform withdrawal button if there's withdrawable amount
if (platformWithdrawable.withdrawable > 0) {
  actionButtons.push([
    Markup.button.callback(
      `ðŸ’° Request Platform Withdrawal ($${platformWithdrawable.withdrawable.toFixed(2)})`,
      "platform_withdrawal_request"
    ),
  ]);
}
```

### 2. Incorrect Company Withdrawable Calculation
**Problem**: Company withdrawable amounts were using `company.billingBalance` instead of calculating based on actual sales and platform fees.

**Fix**: Updated company analytics calculation in `bot/services/adminService.js`:
```javascript
// Calculate actual withdrawable amount based on sales and platform fees
// Withdrawable = Lifetime Revenue - Platform Fees - Already Withdrawn
const alreadyWithdrawn = company.totalWithdrawn || 0;
const withdrawable = Math.max(0, lifetimeRevenue - platformFees - alreadyWithdrawn);
```

### 3. Platform Fees Not Being Added to Platform Balance
**Problem**: Platform fees were being added to admin's `coinBalance` instead of the platform balance.

**Fix**: Updated referral service in `bot/services/referralService.js`:
```javascript
// Update platform balance instead of admin's coinBalance
await adminService.updatePlatformBalance(platformFee);
logger.info(`Platform fee added to platform balance: $${platformFee.toFixed(2)}`);
```

### 4. Company Billing Balance Not Updated on Sales
**Problem**: When sales were made, the company billing balance wasn't being updated with seller earnings.

**Fix**: Added company billing balance update in `bot/handlers/userHandlers.js`:
```javascript
// Update company billing balance with seller earnings
if (product.companyId) {
  try {
    await adminService.updateCompanyBillingBalance(
      product.companyId,
      sellerEarnings
    );
    logger.info(
      `Company ${product.companyId} billing balance updated: +$${sellerEarnings.toFixed(2)}`
    );
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`Error updating company billing balance: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

### 5. Company Total Withdrawn Not Updated on Withdrawal Processing
**Problem**: When company withdrawals were processed, the `totalWithdrawn` field wasn't being updated.

**Fix**: Updated withdrawal processing in `bot/services/adminService.js`:
```javascript
await companyRef.update({
  billingBalance: newBalance,
  totalWithdrawn: (company.totalWithdrawn || 0) + withdrawal.amount,
  lastWithdrawal: {
    amount: withdrawal.amount,
    date: new Date(),
    processedBy: confirmedBy,
  },
});
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. **Platform Analytics Dashboard** will show:
   - Platform withdrawal button when there's a withdrawable amount
   - Correct company withdrawable amounts based on actual sales
   - Proper platform balance and fees

2. **Company Withdrawals** will:
   - Show correct withdrawable amounts

   - Track total withdrawn amounts correctly

3. **Platform Fees** will:
   - Be added to platform balance instead of admin coinBalance

## Testing

The fixes have been tested with sample data and the logic is working correctly:

- âœ… Platform withdrawal button shows when withdrawable > 0
- âœ… Company withdrawable calculation: Lifetime Revenue - Platform Fees - Already Withdrawn
- âœ… Platform fees properly calculated and added to platform balance
- âœ… Company billing balance updated with seller earnings
- âœ… Company total withdrawn updated when withdrawals are processed
- âœ… Platform balance properly updated instead of admin coinBalance

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the fixes to the production environment
2. Monitor the platform analytics dashboard to ensure proper display
3. Test actual sales to verify platform fees are being added correctly
4. Test company withdrawals to ensure amounts are calculated properly
5. Verify platform withdrawal functionality works as expected
